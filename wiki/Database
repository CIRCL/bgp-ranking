# Storage of the IPs
* table IPs
<pre>
ip : the IP address (IPv4/IPv6)
ip_descriptions : relation one to many with the table IPs_descriptions
</pre>
* table IPs_descriptions (information concerning the IPs)<pre>
list_name : obviously.. the name of the list where the ip come from
fetch_date : date we fetch the list (set by default to datetime.datetime.now)
list_date : date of creation of the list
ip : relation many to one with the table IPs
asn : relation many to one with the table ASNs_descriptions</pre>
_list_date_ should be found in the fetched list. *But* it is often not so, for example in the Dshield Top IPs list. In this case, _list_date_ has to be set, for example to today (datetime.date.today()). It is important because this date will be used to verify that this entry is not already in the database! 

* Later: table of comments 

# Storage of the ASNs

* table ASNs
<pre>
asn : the AS Number
asn_description : relation one to many with the table ASNs_descriptions</pre>
* table ASNs_descriptions
<pre>
seen: date we see the AS (set by default to datetime.datetime.now)
owner: of the AS
ips_block: block of the IP owned by the AS
asn: relation many to one with ASNs
ips: relation one to many with IPs_descriptions</pre>
an ASNs_description might have more than one IPs_description: we will probably find for each ips_block more than one IP in the data sets.
