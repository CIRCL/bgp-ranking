This file should give you the easiest way to install the system on your own server. 

If you encour any problem, please just send me a mail or open a bug on github. 


########### Dependencies ###########

First of all, you should take a look at the dependencies file: 
docs/informations/Dependencies

This file gives you a list of packages to install if you are using ubuntu.

I am not absolutely sure that all the packages are available on debian.

########### Installation ###########

Clone the repository :)

If you want to play, use the code available on gitorious: 
	- http://gitorious.org/bgp-ranking
Elsewhere, the code on github is more stable: 
	- http://github.com/Rafiot/bgp-ranking

########## Configuration ###########

The default configuration works on a quadcore with 8 Gb RAM. 
If you don't have this power available, you *really* should take a look at the configuration file: 
- etc/bgp-ranking.conf

And modify each line with "processes". 

Note: Usually, you can put a value like <number of cores>+1 but if you have only one core, "1" is safer.

An other thing to change is the "root" path in directories -> root. 
It is the root directory where you clone the project.

####### Starting the system ########

There is some scripts available in scripts/. 

Before starting the system, edit the file scripts/common.source.sh accordingly to your system. 

When it is done, start first start_redis.sh, init_databases.sh, start_services.sh and finally start_ranking.sh.
