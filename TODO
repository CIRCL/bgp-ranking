Bugfixes
========

* There is actually a problem with the slave database: it takes **to much** time.
  The proper fix it the move the temporary data from the global database to an other one,
  not synchronized with the slave.

Improvements
============

* API (telnet like ?) 
    - get the weight of each source
    - get the rank of a subnet/asn (by whatever you want)

Not trivial
===========

* use python-whois as an external dep instead of the bundled version
  (http://gitorious.org/python-whois)
* read the code of Khanku (http://gitorious.org/~khanku/bgp-ranking/predictive-bgp-ranking/)
  ans find a way to handle this usage of the ranking system in the main trunk
* Extract interesting informations of the bview file, prepare to do a diff 
    egrep -w "^$|PREFIX:|ASPATH:"| awk -F' ' '{print $NF}' |  sed 's/^$/XXXXX/' | tr '\n' ' ' | sed 's/XXXXX/\n/g'| sed 's/^ //' | sort | uniq


Whishlist
=========

* Module which ping a list of URL known as malicious and insert the IP in the system.
