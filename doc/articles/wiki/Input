# Introduction

 The idea is to build a ranking system to rank autonomous system number (ASN) over time on the Internet. The main part of the project is to gather and collect datasets across Internet
to come with the required information for creating the ranking. The ranking system is mainly there to give information about the "security" quality of an ASN and maybe his neighbours (upstream
or downstream). The ranking is value between 0 - 100 specifying the risk associated with an ASN. 0  means that the trust is high / 100 means the trust is low and risk is very high. 

## Internet dataset

* List of "suspicious IP" - http://www.dshield.org/xml.html (a good start for feeding the initial database structure) and https://zeustracker.abuse.ch/blocklist.php
* RIPE RIS - Where to get which networks are announced by which ASN? - http://www.ripe.net/ris/riswhois.html 
* [Python script](http://bsd.dischaos.com/2009/07/22/getting-all-prefixes-advertised-by-an-as/) for information, get all the IPs of an AS
* [Wrapper for whois](http://code.google.com/p/pywhois/), python, MIT Licence, might be a good start to make a real wrapper 
* Overall allocation of ASN to RIR - http://www.iana.org/assignments/as-numbers/ -  

## Flow/import process

* (at regular interval, every day?) - import of existing ASN number with their description - to trace evolution of ASN
* (at regular interval, every day) - import list of suspicious IP from dshield 
** Importing ASN announcing the suspicious IP
** Importing ASN all announced networks
* Calculating over a specific time period (per 24 hours), the ranking based on the number of suspicious versus the
total announced network from the ASN
* Voting mechanism to increase risk ranking or not


## Data structure

### ASN table

<pre>
 ASN int(32bits)
 date varchar
 description varchar
 whois varchar
</pre>

If the ASN number is evolving when compared (as fetched at a regular interval), a new entry is created. To keep track of AS previously used by other ISP.

### net object announced

<pre>
 net varchar
 ASN int(32bits)
 firstseen date
 lastseen date
 whois varchar
</pre>

### suspicious IP

<pre>
 net varchar
 source int
 ASN int(32bits)
 firstseen date
 lastseen date
</pre>
