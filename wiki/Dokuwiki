When a new page is saved some files are created by [dokuwiki](http://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki):
<pre>$DOKUWIKI_HOME/data/meta/pagename.{changes,indexed,meta}
$DOKUWIKI_HOME/data/pages/pagename.txt</pre>

The length of pagename is not checked and dokuwiki attempt to save the files directly, It is a problem because of the maximal length of the file name authorized by the file system. 

## Example: 

If the file system is ext4, the maximal length is 256 bytes (256 chars in UTF-8). If the page name length equals 250, dokuwiki will only be able to create  
<pre>$DOKUWIKI_HOME/data/meta/pagename.meta and 
$DOKUWIKI_HOME/data/pages/pagename.txt</pre>

This two files are enough to see the content and to edit the page but the revisions are not saved!
