Trivial:
- use redis transactions to improve the speed of the whole system

Almost trivial:
- use python-whois as an external dep instead of the bundled version (http://gitorious.org/python-whois)
- improve the import of the config file (see python-whois for a solution)

Not trivial:
- do not create a new key for each subnet in the ranking
