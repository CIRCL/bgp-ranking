We put only one time a RIS Whois entry in the database until there is a change somewhere in the entry. 

The entry waved in the Db (table ASNsDescriptions) are the following: the ASN, the description and... *the subnet*!

By selecting the ASNsDescriptions it is possible to select all the IPsDescriptions connected to this ASN particular Description. 
By selecting in the IPsDescriptions only the ones of a particular day, it will work :) 

Compute a ranking by subnet is very simple!


Have fun :)
