Problem Statement

The satelite operators are often ISP and provide Internet servides for their customers but also other ISPs. Because of this other ISPs, the satellite operators announce their prefixes but not only! They announce also prefixes from other ISPs. 

The Security monirtoring is challenging including mitigation of malicious activities.

Datasource and their datasets 

There is a large variety of datasets including IP and/or prefixes for malicious activities. The level of trust of each dataset is variable (for example Dshield versus Arbor ATLAS/Active thread feed)
