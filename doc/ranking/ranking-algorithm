== BGP Ranking Algorithm ==

R   -> Ranking of an AS
 AS

Occ   -> #(ip,source)
   AS

source -> source of the unique occurrences (e.g. dshield, Arbor Atlas, Shadowserver,...)
source_impact -> (0 -> 1000, from useless to significant) the impact of a source (the trust on a source)

source | source_impact
----------------------
dshield| 1
ArborA | 20
ShadowS| 10
AbuseA | 2

Vote  is the value if someone voted against the AS. 1 : default/no vote:.
    AS

ASsize is just the total number of IP addresses announced by the AS.

R   = 1 +( ( SUM(Occ  * source_impact) * Vote  ))
 AS                AS                       AS 
         (--------------------------------------)
                        ASsize 

== Notes on the algorithm ==

* Each Occ per source is unique even if we see multiple the same IP address for the same source
* We can see the same IP address among the different source, the formula is not limiting that as
  this usually a good sign of malicious activities. The information is valided by multiple sources.

=== Example ===

Unique IP occurrences for each source for AS 1234 with ASsize of 2048 IP addresses :

(10, dshield)
(5, ArborA)
(3, ShadowS)
(4, AbuseA)

The AS vote is 1 (no one voted against this AS).

R        =  1+((10*1+5*20+3*10+4*2)*1)/2048 
 AS1234 

R        = 1.07226562500000000000
