v1.1.4 - 2011-06-15

New:
 * /!\ Compatible with redis and redis-py >=2.4. You should use hiredis-py.
 * JSON interface: replace asn{s,_details} by json on the address bar
                   and get the JSON dumps.
 * IMPORTANT: The modules are now loaded dynamically.
              You will have to edit etc/bgpranking.conf and move the
              configuration to etc/bgpranking.conf.redis (see example)
              Then, launch add_modules.py to populate the redis config database.
 * The config database contains:
      - The names of the modules
      - The impact of the modules
      - The URL where the dataset is downloaded
      - The path to put the dataset
 * New modules: malc0de, Sucuri, EmergingThreatsCompromized, EmergingThreatsRBN
